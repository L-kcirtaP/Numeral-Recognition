Digit Recognition
===============

This is a simple machine learning program to recognize digits.
---------------

* Objective:
  Implement the digit recoginition from 1 to 9. The training, testing and predicting data are all in the form of txt, represented by 32*32 arrays.

* Method:
  K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm, and implemented by Python.


* As a result, the accuracy of recognition is 90.81% by testing. The accuracy of prediction is 100%.
